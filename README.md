# UFOs ðŸ‘½


## Overview of analysis:
The purpose of this project is to collect and display the information found on UFO sightings in California. 
We will create a web application that will let you, the user, examine and investigate the data on the sightings.  
What will you decide? â€¦â€¦ Are UFOâ€™s real? 

## Results:

How many sightings did we find? 
California has seen 30 UFO sightings! 50% of those sightings taking place in the San Diego County.

Then go to data and filter a city to narrow down the results. Type â€˜el cajonâ€™, and see what sightings were reported in that city.

You can even see the duration of the sightings.

## Summary ðŸ‘¾
The parameters are restricted to the locations of the sightings. If a user where to input an area where the sightings did not occur, there will be no results. 
The user would have to scroll through the sightings and then narrow down the search. 
If only there were more UFO sightingsâ€¦.
